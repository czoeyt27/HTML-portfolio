<h1>My favourite movies of all time</h1>
<h2>Top 5 movies you should watch</h2>
<hr />

<h3>The Blind Side</h3>
<p>This movie teaches us that sometimes our blessings come from where we least expect.If you feeling down, then this is definitely a beautiful movie to teach us that we can always get where we want to; just not how we expect. </p>

<h3>The Intern</h3>
<p>I loved how Robert De Niro came in as just the old guy and gradually became the most reliable person in that workplace. In his role he was calm, attentive and very thoughtful. </p>

<h3>Transformers</h3>
<p>Very cool sci fi, it seems believable. I am obsessed with Optimus Prime's voice, dominant but gentle.</p>

<h3>The Best Man Holiday</h3>
<p>Funny, but real. It shows how important it is to spend time with your loved ones.</p>

<h3>Fast and the Furious 8</h3>
<p>It will keep you guessing, very interesting twists and turns! Charlize Theron plays one heck of a villian-hands down!</p>
